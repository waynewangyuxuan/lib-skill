# Relations Vocabulary — shared edge types for the entity graph

Entity `## Relations` edges power two consumers: **lib-search** (traversal / context
assembly) and **lib-review** (graph-health audit). A type carries a **tier** (how
strongly to follow) and a **direction** (store once, on the passive/derivative side;
the reverse is a `grep`). This file is the single source of truth — lib-entity writes
by it, lib-search/lib-review read by it.

## Core families

Never invent a new *family*. Mint a vivid specialization only when it adds information
over the core type — then infer its family by meaning to get its tier + direction.

| Tier | Family | Core type — direction | Specialization examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 backbone | Structural | `part-of` child→parent | — |
| 1 backbone | Dependency | `uses` consumer→resource; `provided-by` resource→provider | shares-engine-with, tracked-in |
| 2 context | Provenance | `created-by` thing→maker | authored-by, introduced-by, realized-by, originated-in, prototyped-by, proposed-by |
| 2 context | Lineage | `derived-from` derivative→source; `supersedes`/`superseded-by` (lifecycle, both sides) | inspired-by, builds-on |
| 2 context | Evaluation | `evidence-for`; `baseline-for`/`uses-baseline`; `compares-with` | competes-with, similar-to, contrasts-with, distillation-subject-of |
| 2 context | Social | `led-by` thing→lead; `collaborator` project→person; `recommended-by` thing→person | reviews/reviewed-by, guest-lecturer, involves, co-authored |
| 2 context | Application | `applied-to` concept→use; `studied-in` artifact→research/learning line; `feeds-into` tool→projects | guards, central-to |
| 3 loose | Generic | `related-to` (symmetric); `references` X→cited | — |

**Three types that drain the overloaded `related-to`** (use these instead of defaulting to `related-to`):
- `studied-in` — an artifact/concept is a reading or topic *within* a research or learning line (e.g. a survey → `[[AI工程的学习和经验]]`).
- `feeds-into` — a skill/tool that applies *across* several projects (e.g. `[[skill-battlefield]]` → Robin, MyLibrary).
- `contrasts-with` — a deliberate counterpoint / 反面锚点, **not** a neutral comparison (use `compares-with`/`similar-to` for neutral).

## Direction rule

Store each edge **once, on the passive/derivative side**, pointing at the canonical/active
side; the reverse is a `grep`:
- child→parent, consumer→resource, thing→maker, derivative→source, workstream→lead-person, concept→where-applied.
- **Pick the most specific core type that fits; `related-to` is the last resort** — including the mandatory hub-attachment when minting a new entity (see lib-entity Nested Heading Promotion).
- **Exception:** the lifecycle pair (`supersedes`/`superseded-by`) lives on *both* pages — staleness must show from the old page ("use the newer one") and the new page alike.

## How lib-search traverses (maps to the three query depths)

- **Layer 1 (index scan)** — name/tag match; no edge following.
- **Layer 2 (page read)** — follow **Tier 1 + Tier 2** one hop (backbone + meaningful context).
- **Layer 3 (deep aggregation)** — expand **all tiers** recursively, incl. Tier-3.
- On any `superseded-by`, redirect to the newer entity — don't treat the stale page as live context.

## How lib-review audits

- **Structural orphan** = a node with **no Tier-1 edge** (`part-of` / `uses`). Loose-only nodes count as orphans, not as connected.
- **Under-typed** = a node/hub whose neighbors are **only Tier-3** (`related-to` / `references`) → flag for re-typing to a specific core type.
